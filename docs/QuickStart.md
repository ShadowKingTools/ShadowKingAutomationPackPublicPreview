# Quick Start (Public Preview)

This repo is a **public preview** of a PowerShell-first "routine launcher" concept.

## What this preview includes
- Docs + **safe sample routines** (no system tweaks)
- No background services
- No telemetry
- Everything readable

## What it does NOT include
- The full paid/private routine pack
- Any aggressive tweaks or registry edits

## How to run a sample
1. Download this repo as ZIP (Code → Download ZIP)
2. Unzip
3. Open PowerShell in the folder
4. Run:
   ./samples/SampleRoutine-Hello.ps1

## Feedback I’m looking for
- Repo structure + naming
- Logging + safety patterns
- How you'd expect "restore baseline" to work safely
