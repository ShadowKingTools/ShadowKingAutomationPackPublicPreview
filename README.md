# Shadow King Automation Pack (Public Preview)
updated: 02/09/2026
A clean, reversible Windows “game mode” workflow for handhelds and gaming PCs.

Built for devices like:
- ROG Ally / Ally X
- Legion Go
- Other Windows-based handhelds

This project exists because I got tired of manually tweaking Windows every time I wanted to game.

## What This Does

This pack helps you:

- Reduce background CPU/RAM usage
- Disable unnecessary services while gaming
- Optimize power/performance balance
- Restore everything when you’re done

No registry hacks.  
No permanent changes.  
No bloat.

Everything is reversible.

## Why Not Just Use Max TDP?

On most modern APUs, pushing past ~22–25W often gives diminishing returns.

More watts usually means:
- More heat
- More fan noise
- Less battery life
- Minimal FPS gain

This workflow focuses on efficiency, not brute force.

---

## How It Works

1. Run the optimization script before gaming
2. Play
3. Run the restore script when finished

That’s it.

Your system goes back to normal.

---

## Safety & Transparency

- All scripts are readable
- No hidden processes
- No telemetry
- No startup installs
- No background services

If you don’t like it, delete it.

Nothing is left behind.
