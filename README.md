# Shadow King Automation Pack (Public Preview)

A clean, reversible “game mode” workflow for Windows handhelds and gaming PCs.

Built for devices like:
- ROG Ally / Ally X  
- Legion Go  
- Windows-based handhelds  
- Compact gaming PCs  

This project focuses on improving performance, stability, and battery life
without permanent system changes.

## Why This Exists

If you game on Windows handhelds, you’ve probably dealt with:

- Background services eating performance  
- Inconsistent FPS  
- Random stutter  
- Battery drain  
- Having to “re-tweak” Windows constantly  

I got tired of fixing the same things over and over.

So I started building a repeatable, reversible setup
that puts the system into a clean “game mode”
and restores everything when you’re done.

No registry hacks.  
No risky scripts.  
No permanent changes.

## What This Does

This automation pack helps you:

- Reduce unnecessary background activity  
- Prioritize game-related processes  
- Improve frame consistency  
- Reduce heat and power waste  
- Restore default settings afterward  

Everything is designed to be transparent and reversible.

## How It Works

The workflow is built around:

- Power and process tuning  
- Background task cleanup  
- Priority management  
- Optional device profiles  
- Restore routines  

You can review all scripts and routines in this repository.

Nothing runs silently.
Nothing is hidden.

## Safety & Philosophy

This project follows three rules:

1. No permanent system modification  
2. No undocumented changes  
3. No vendor lock-in  

If something doesn’t work for you,
you can undo it in seconds.

This is meant to help you understand and control your device,
not lock you into a black box.

## Getting Started

1. Review the repository structure  
2. Read the documentation in `/docs`  
3. Check `/routines` for automation logic  
4. Test on your device  
5. Adjust as needed  

This is a public preview and still evolving.

Feedback is welcome.

## Optional: Expanded Version

This public preview shows the structure and approach.

I also maintain a more polished version with:

- Guided installer  
- Preset profiles  
- Auto-restore tools  
- Device-specific tuning  
- Ongoing updates

No pressure.

The public version will always remain available.
